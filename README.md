# INTRODUCTION

**Final Project**

Airline companiesâ€™ delays

The non-punctuality of commercial flights causes enormous losses every year. A
flight delay can mean the loss of a call, an overnight stay at the airport
waiting for the next call, and ultimately, a deal undone by being late or not
attending an important meeting.

This initiative is part of the [Digital Transition Action Plan](https://eportugal.gov.pt/noticias/governo-lanca-plano-de-acao-para-a-transicao-digital), approved in April 2020,
and its main goal is to respond to the needs of companies with qualified
resources in digital technologies. In addition, the UpSkill programme offers
unemployed candidates the opportunity to have the necessary knowledge to start
a new career.

The Programme consists of 6 months of intensive training in specific areas of
information and communication technologies, followed by 3 months of on-the-job
training in one of the participating companies.
