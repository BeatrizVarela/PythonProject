# INTRODUCTION

**Final Project**

Airline companies’ delays

The non-punctuality of commercial flights causes enormous losses every year. A
flight delay can mean the loss of a call, an overnight stay at the airport
waiting for the next call, and ultimately, a deal undone by being late or not
attending an important meeting.

This work aims to analyze the phenomenon of delays in commercial flights, using
data from the United States Department of Transportation. The Bureau of
Transportation Statistics publishes all kinds of statistics on US commercial
aviation. Based on this data we are interested in the following top 10
indicators:

- The average delay by airline, expressed in minutes;
- The ratio of delayed flights, by airline;
- The average delay by destination airport, expressed in minutes;
- The ratio of flights delayed to arrival, by destination airport.

The result should be presented in the form of a figure with four bar graphs
similar to Figura 1 on [Project ED - Final - EN.pdf](https://github.com/BeatrizVarela/PythonProject/blob/python-master/Project%20ED%20-%20Final%20-%20EN.pdf).

The file with the data is related to a single month and must include the
columns with year and month (same for all lines), so that it is possible to
extract from one of the lines the information to be placed in the title of the
figure (“February 2015”) in the example on the next page).
